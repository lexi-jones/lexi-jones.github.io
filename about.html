Hello! I am Lexi Jones-Kellett, a Biological Oceanography Ph.D. candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. 
I work in Mick Follows' <a href="https://darwinproject.mit.edu/">Darwin Project</a> group at MIT. Before that, I obtained an Honors Scholar B.A. in Mathematics 
with Minors in Physics and Business from Temple University. I first became interested in scientific research working in 
Rob Kulthinal's <a href="http://www.bioinform.org/">Evolutionary Genetics and Biological Informatics lab</a>. Then, working on projects with the NASA Student Airborne
Research Project (SARP) and NASA DEVELOP in California, I became obsessed with phytoplankton and decided to pursue a career in oceanography. 
To learn more about the projects that I am working on now, check out my <a href="https://lexi-jones.github.io/research/">Research page</a>.
