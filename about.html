Welcome! I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) Department at MIT, working 
in the <a href="https://darwinproject.mit.edu/">Darwin Project Group</a> led by Dr. Mick Follows. I have a Biological Oceanography 
Ph.D. from the MIT-WHOI Joint Program (2024) and a Mathematics B.A. with Minors in Physics and Business from Temple University (2018).

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My research focus is on the role of mesoscale circulations in shaping phytoplankton communities from a Lagrangian perspective. The big
picture goal is to ultimately understand how the ubiquitous mesoscale interactions in the ocean aggregate to support global biogeochemical
cycles and the ocean food web. Though this work, I bridge physical and biological oceanography and use a combination of satellite remote 
sensing observations, in situ observations (e.g. amplicon sequencing, flow cytometry, autonomous vehicles), and numerical simulations. For
more details and links to my publications, see my <a href="research.html">Research page</a>.

<h3>Background</h3>
My research career began in Rob Kulthinal's <a href="http://www.bioinform.org/">Evolutionary Genetics and Biological Informatics lab</a> at 
Temple University. Then, working on projects with the NASA Student Airborne Research Project (SARP) and NASA DEVELOP in California, I became 
decided to pursue a career in oceanography.
