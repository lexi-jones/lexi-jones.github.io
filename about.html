Hello! I am Lexi Jones-Kellett, a Biological Oceanography Ph.D. candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. 
I currently work in Mick Follows' Darwin Project group at MIT. Before that I, obtained an Honors Scholar B.A. in Mathematics 
with Minors in Physics and Business from Temple University. I first became interested in scientific research working in 
Rob Kulthinal's Evolutionary Genetics and Biological Informatics lab. Then working on projects with the NASA Student Airborne
Research Project (SARP) and NASA DEVELOP in California, I was hooked on a career in oceanography. To learn more about what I am
working on now, check out the Research page.
