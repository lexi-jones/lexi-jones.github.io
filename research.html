<h3>Air-Sea Exchange of Carbon in Eddies</h3>
The Surface Ocean CO<sub>2</sub> Atlas (SOCAT) project has collected <b>35.6 million</b> observations of carbon dioxide 
in the ocean as of 2022. With this open source dataset, it is now possible to investigate fluctations in the air-sea exchange 
of carbon in smaller ocean features such as eddies. I worked on this project primarily as a mentor to MIT undergraduate 
Sydney Kim and MIT Masters' student Christine Padalino. Christine was co-advised by me, Greg Britten, and Mick Follows on this
collaborative project. She defended her thesis April 28, 2023, entitled "The effect of eddies on fCO2 in the North Pacific surface
 ocean". We are currently working on a manuscript describing the results of Christine's thesis and additional follow-up work.
