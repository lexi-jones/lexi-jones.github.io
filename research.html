<h1>Impacts of Eddies Coherency on Chlorophyll-a Concentration</h1>


# Mesoscale Phytoplankton Variability from the SCOPE Gradients 4 Cruise


# Air-Sea Exchange of Carbon in Eddies
The Surface Ocean CO<sub>2</sub> Atlas (SOCAT) project has collected <b>35.6 million</b> observations of carbon dioxide in the ocean as of 2022. This incredible feat makes it now possible to investigate fluctations in the air-sea exchange of carbon in smaller ocean features.
