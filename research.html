<h3>Air-Sea Exchange of Carbon in Eddies</h3>
The Surface Ocean CO<sub>2</sub> Atlas (SOCAT) project has collected <b>35.6 million</b> observations of carbon dioxide 
in the ocean as of 2022. With this open source dataset, it is now possible to investigate fluctations in the air-sea exchange 
of carbon in smaller ocean features such as eddies. I worked on this project primarily as a mentor to MIT undergraduate 
Sydney Kim and MIT Masters' student Christine Padalino. Christine was co-advised by me, Greg Britten, and Mick Follows on this
collaborative project. She defended her thesis in April 2023, entitled "The effect of eddies on fCO2 in the North Pacific surface
ocean". We are currently working on a manuscript describing the results of Christine's thesis and additional follow-up work.

<h3>Biogeochemical Argo Floats in the Lofoten Basin Eddy</h3>
Argo floats equipped with biogeochemical sensors (BGC-Argo) continuously take measurements of optical properities the vertical water column. While eddies are commonly
studied from the surface by satellites, BGC-Argo provides a unique insight into processes happening at depth. This project focuses on BGC-Argo floats in and around the
Lofoten Basin Eddy, a semi-permanent anticyclone located off of the coast of Norway. A manuscript led by Daniel Kostner is in preparation, examining differences in 
particulate organic carbon (POC) in the eddy compared to surrounding waters.
