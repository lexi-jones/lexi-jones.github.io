<h3>Impacts of Eddy Coherency on Chlorophyll-a Concentration</h3>

In this remote sensing project, we use a Lagrangian perspective to re-examine the idealized assumption that mesoscale eddies are 
laterally coherent with the ability to trap and transport phytoplankton populations. We find that the trapping strengths
of features in a subtropical gyre evolve over their lifetimes, and only half are strictly Lagrangian coherent at any given time. 
This effects the concentration of phytoplankton observed in eddies, where trapping locally elevates patches of chlorophyll 
concentration more so than their leaky counterparts. Nevertheless, leaky eddies also alter chlorophyll concentrations and 
their contribution to primary productivity may be underestimated because these biological responses are not preserved for long 
timescales.

<h3>Mesoscale Phytoplankton Variability in the Eastern North Pacific</h3>

I went on the SCOPE Gradients 4 Cruise in November and December of 2021 where I led a samplign campaign to filter surface seawater
samples at 46-km intervals along a cruise transect spanning the southern California Current System and the oligotrophic North Pacific 
Subtropical Gyre. During the DNA extraction process, I spiked the samples with genomic standards which enabled evaluation of the 
absolute volumetric gene copy abundances of 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (amplified with 515Y-926R universal primers).
We found that this method yielded remarkable agreement of picocyanobacteria cell abundances, as validated with analogous flow cytometry
measurements. A publication is in preparation evaluating how mesoscale currents shape phytoplankton variability along this 
cruise transect.

<h3>Air-Sea Exchange of Carbon in Eddies</h3>
The Surface Ocean CO<sub>2</sub> Atlas (SOCAT) project has collected <b>35.6 million</b> observations of carbon dioxide 
in the ocean as of 2022. With this open source dataset, it is now possible to investigate fluctations in the air-sea exchange 
of carbon in smaller ocean features such as eddies. I worked on this project primarily as a mentor to MIT undergraduate 
Sydney Kim and MIT Masters' student Christine Padalino. Christine was co-advised by me, Greg Britten, and Mick Follows on this
collaborative project. She defended her thesis in April 2023, entitled "The effect of eddies on fCO2 in the North Pacific surface
ocean". We are currently working on a manuscript describing the results of Christine's thesis and additional follow-up work.

<h3>Biogeochemical Argo Floats in the Lofoten Basin Eddy</h3>
Argo floats equipped with biogeochemical sensors (BGC-Argo) continuously take measurements of optical properities the vertical water column. While eddies are commonly
studied from the surface by satellites, BGC-Argo provides a unique insight into processes happening at depth. This project focuses on BGC-Argo floats in and around the
Lofoten Basin Eddy, a semi-permanent anticyclone located off of the coast of Norway. A manuscript led by Daniel Kostner is in under review, examining differences in 
particulate organic carbon (POC) in the eddy compared to surrounding waters.
