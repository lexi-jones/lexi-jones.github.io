I think an appropriate first post is to describe how I built this website since I just did it! My goal for the website is for it to be a landing page with links to my various professional pages, include information about my research, and host blog posts like this one. For the design, I wanted something minimalistic and streamlined so that I did not have to make a lot of adjustments over time.
