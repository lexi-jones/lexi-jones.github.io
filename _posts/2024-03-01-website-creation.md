I think an appropriate first post is to describe how I built this website, hopefully making it easier for you than it was for me. My goal is for the website to be a landing page with links to my various professional pages, include information about my research, and host blog posts like this one. For the design, I wanted something minimalistic and streamlined so that I did not have to make a lot of adjustments over time. 

I was drawn to using GitHub Pages as my website builder because my work is computational, and GitHub is the most trusted platform to host code. Although this route is not as user-friendly as others (e.g. Squarespace, Wix, etc.), it is free, and my website URL matches my GitHub page. As a bonus, it inherently requires extra practice using GitHub and Git commands, which I am always trying to get better at.

If youâ€™re ok with a little pain and a lot of gain, follow along to make your own GitHub website! 

# Setup

Free, pre-designed [templates from Jekyll](https://jekyllthemes.io/free) can be directly incorporated into a GitHub Pages website. I chose the [Minimal Mistakes](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/minimal-mistakes) theme, then clicked the button `Get Minimal Mistakes on GitHub` at the top of the landing page.

I tried a few options described [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/), but the easiest method was to fork the repository. For your site, you should name the forked repository `[github-username].github.io`. I tested naming it something other than my GitHub username and ran into problems building the website.
